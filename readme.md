this is my attempt to compile and use on Unix/Windows Liu Ling's port of Oberon-07 compiler to AVR micros.

the code is cleaned up, AOS, I guess, PACO compiler, at the time, was initializing uninitialized variables to 0, while oo2c did not. thus the code is a bit different, and is better, than in original version.

this version is not in sync with Wirth's Oberon-07 version for RISC cpu he have had designed.
